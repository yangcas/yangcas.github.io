<p>I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/locations/cambridge-uk/" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, Cambridge, UK, specializing in multimodal data processing and machine learning.  
My research bridges physical modeling, signal processing, and intelligent computation, enabling systems that understand human physiology, environment, and interaction in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a Marie Curie Research Fellow at The University of Sheffield, UK, where I led an EU Horizon 2020 project on battery-free backscatter communications under the supervision of 
<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee/people/academic-staff/xiaoli-chu" target="_blank">Professor Xiaoli Chu</a>.</p>


<p>I received a Ph.D. in Communication and Information Systems from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), China, in July 2019, supervised by 
<a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/yangyang/" target="_blank">Professor Yang Yang</a>. 
I also earned a M.Eng. in Software Engineering from Beihang University in 2016, 
and a B.Eng. in Microelectronics from Anhui University in 2012.</p>

<p>I am always seeking <strong>new opportunities and collaborations</strong> that allow me to explore and expand the boundaries of multimodal technologies. I welcome partnerships that bridge research, innovation, and real-world impact.</p>

<h2 id="multimodal" short-label="ðŸ“Š Multimodal ML & Healthcare"><i class="ion-ios-gear"></i> Multimodal Sensing and Human-Centered Machine Learning</h2>

I design AI-enhanced wearable and earable systems that fuse multimodal data from diverse sensors, including photoplethysmography (PPG), inertial measurement units (IMUs), acoustic and temperature sensors, ultra-wideband (UWB), millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, and virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR) interfaces to interpret physiological and behavioral states.
The <a href="#omnibuds">OmniBuds</a> platform, developed collaboratively within our team, became a major spin-off project in 2024 and established a global research ecosystem for multimodal earable intelligence.
I also lead projects such as <a href="#earfusion">EarFusion</a>, <a href="#spatium">SPATIUM</a>, and <a href="#mmhvital">mmHvital</a>, which advance embedded machine learning, signal-quality-aware fusion, and spatiotemporal context modeling for health perception and humanâ€“computer interaction.

<h2 id="signal" short-label="ðŸŽ¤ Speech, Audio, and Acoustics"><i class="ion-wifi"></i> Physics-Informed Signal Processing for Data-Driven Intelligence</h2>
<p>
I explore physics-informed and data-driven signal processing combined with neural architectures to advance speech, audio, acoustic, and radio sensing, and lead several research projects in this direction.
<a href="#lpcse">LPCSE</a> demonstrate how classical physical and rule-based models can be embedded within end-to-end machine learning frameworks to achieve efficient, interpretable, and physically grounded intelligence.
Projects on <a href="#auditory">Auditory Attention</a> decoding and otoacoustic emission analysis build on physiological and auditory principles to interpret received signals and extract informative features, enabling data-driven learning and inference.
The <a href="#pamt">PAMT</a> project studies multipath-induced phase distortion across acoustic frequencies and introduces a real-time metric and mitigation strategy, achieving millimetre-level acoustic ranging and motion tracking with commercial microphones and speakers.
The <a href="#backscatter">Radio and Acoustic Backscatter</a> project develops ultra-low-power wireless sensor nodes that harvest energy from ambient radio waves and embed acoustic information into backscattered RF signals.
