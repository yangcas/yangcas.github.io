<p>I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/locations/cambridge-uk/" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, Cambridge, UK.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a Marie Curie Research Fellow at The University of Sheffield, UK, where I worked under the supervision of 
<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee/people/academic-staff/xiaoli-chu" target="_blank">Professor Xiaoli Chu</a>. 
During this time, I led a EU Horizon 2020-funded project on battery-free backscatter communications.</p>

<p>Currently, my research focuses on wearable devices, digital health, wireless sensing, and embedded machine learning. 
I am passionate about exploring diverse wireless signals—including acoustic, RF, UWB, mmWave and visible light—to enable novel technologies such as vital signs monitoring, indoor localization and motion tracking, and ultra-low power or battery-free systems.</p>

<p>My projects involve end-to-end development of hardware and software systems, with extensive real-world deployments. 
These experiences have equipped me with interdisciplinary, hands-on skills in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced signal processing and machine learning for wireless signals</li>
  <li>Wireless sensing and localization</li>
  <li>Low-power embedded system design</li>
  <li>Rapid hardware prototyping</li>
  <li>User study design for wearable sensing</li>
</ul>

<p>I received a Ph.D. in Communication and Information Systemsfrom the 
University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), China, in July 2019, supervised by 
<a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/yangyang/" target="_blank">Professor Yang Yang</a>. 
I also earned a M.Eng. in Software Engineering from Beihang University in 2016, 
and a B.Eng. in Microelectronics from Anhui University in 2012.</p>

<p>I am always looking for <strong>new opportunities and challenges</strong> that allow me to explore and push the boundaries of wireless technologies. <strong>I warmly welcome collaborations</strong>.</p>
