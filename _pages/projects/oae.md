### TEOAE Measurement Beyond Clinical Settings: Intermittent Acquisition and Computation in Everyday Audio [To appear]

This work investigates how Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs), a standard non-invasive hearing assessment technique, can be extended beyond traditional clinical setups into everyday listening environments.  
We propose a framework that intermittently embeds TEOAE click stimuli within natural audio content such as podcasts, enabling passive hearing screening without requiring dedicated hardware or clinical supervision.
A controlled pilot study was conducted to analyze listener perception and measurement fidelity across varying click densities. Results show that lower stimulus density is preferred by listeners for reduced perceptual intrusion, while maintaining sufficient TEOAE signal quality for reliable estimation. This approach found a promising pathway toward media-integrated auditory screening systems, paving the way for unobtrusive and accessible hearing health monitoring using commodity devices.
