We proposed OmniBuds, an advanced AI-powered earbud and earable research platform that became a successful spin-off project in 2024. OmniBuds represents a major effort to bridge consumer-grade audio technology with scientific research, enabling multimodal bio-sensing and on-device machine learning within a compact, wearable form factor. The first wave of distribution has reached over 30 universities across more than 10 countries, establishing OmniBuds as a global open platform that empowers the research community to explore next-generation earable intelligence.

OmniBuds integrates a comprehensive suite of sensors, including PPG for cardiovascular monitoring, 9-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs), which include a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis magnetometer for motion and spatial tracking, skin temperature sensors, and multiple microphones (one inward-facing and two outward-facing) for both in-ear physiological sensing and ambient acoustic capture.

Each earbud is equipped with an embedded machine learning accelerator that supports efficient, low-power computation for real-time multimodal data analysis.
Built upon a True Wireless Stereo (TWS) design, OmniBuds also retains standard audio functionalities such as active noise cancellation (ANC), transparency mode, music playback, and phone calls, providing both research flexibility and everyday usability.
