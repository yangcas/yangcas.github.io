<p>
We proposed OmniBuds, an advanced earable research platform designed to enable multimodal bio-sensing and on-device machine learning. Unlike conventional wearables that rely on cloud-based processing, OmniBuds offers direct access to raw physiological data, supporting privacy-preserving, real-time analysis. It integrates a wide array of sensors, including PPG, temperature, IMUs, and multiple microphones, all within a compact True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbud form factor. Equipped with an embedded machine learning accelerator, OmniBuds enables efficient on-device computation, optimized for low power consumption to support continuous operation. This platform is ideal for researchers aiming to explore health-aware wearable intelligence and real-time physiological monitoring.
